# MEPper
*Map scribbing for old school games*

## Hosted App
You can access the github hosted app <a href="https://moltenhead.github.io/MEPper/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<hr/>

## What it does
This little app is aiming to become a **tool for old-school games players**; those who dont want *- or don't know how,* to draw a map without **overcrowding** nor making it **unreadable** afterwards.

There is still alot to add and make, but here it is for those who'd like to use it anyway.
