## What it does
This little app is aiming to become a **tool for old-school games players**; those who dont want *- or don't know how,* to draw a map without **overcrowding** nor making it **unreadable afterwards**.
<br/><br/>
There is still alot to add and make, but here it is for those who'd like to use it anyway.
